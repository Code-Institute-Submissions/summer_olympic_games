A Century Of Medals At The Summer Olympic Games Dashboard


This project is a dashboard displaying data based on the number of medals won at the Summer Olympic Games between 1900 and 2000.
The user can interact with the charts via a web browser and the data displayed dynamically changes according to the user selection.
The main aim behind the project is to show the use of Python,D3, Flask and MongoDB. It also includes the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Built With

* [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) - Code Editor.
* [Google](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) - Web Browser.
* [Mongo Management Studio](http://mms.litixsoft.de/index.php?lang=en) - Database Management Solution.

## Versioning

I use [Git]https://git-scm.com/ and github for versioning. For the versions available, please see [summer_olympic_games](https://github.com/martinallard/summer_olympic_games). 

## Testing
* My main test tool was using inspector in Google Chrome web browser.

## Technology Used

* Bootstrap - For responsive design and layout.
* D3.js - JavaScript library used for manipulating the html based on data and user interaction.
* Flask - Web framework for Python used for database-driven websites. I used Flask as the Dashboard needed to be viewed via a web browser and the data displayed is from a document-oriented database.
* MongoDB - Free open-source cross-platform document-oriented database used for storing the data on the Summer Olympic Games. 
* Font Awesome - For icons in chart area and Buttons.
* Favicomatic.com - To generate code for favicon.


## Color Palette

The color palette is based on the hex values for the 5 rings within the Olympic Games Logo.

## Google Font Family's Baloo

I picked Google font family Baloo for a retro look to the heading of the dashboard as its data is only up to the year 2000.
